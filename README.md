Mentor Mingle is an AI agent that helps you prepare for your next interview. It is a chatbot that can answer your questions about a company, a job role, or a specific interview question. It can also help you practice your interview skills by conducting a mock interview with you. 
It can also help you prepare for your interview by giving you a list of questions that you can practice answering.
